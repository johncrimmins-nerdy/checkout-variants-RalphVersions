# Documentation Cleanup Rules

## Principle: Keep Only Critical Information

Documentation should contain only essential information that helps developers understand the app's architecture, unique features, and critical implementation details. Remove obvious, repetitive, or verbose content.

## What to Remove

### Obvious Installation Steps

- Standard `git clone` explanations
- Basic `npm install` instructions
- Common development server setup
- Generic prerequisite lists (Node.js, npm, etc.)

### Verbose Feature Lists

- Marketing-style bullet points with excessive detail
- Repetitive feature descriptions
- Over-explained benefits that are self-evident
- Multiple sections covering the same information

### Step-by-Step Tutorials

- Basic command explanations that are self-documenting
- Obvious workflow descriptions
- Generic troubleshooting sections
- Detailed examples for simple operations

### Redundant Sections

- Multiple sections explaining the same concept
- Repetitive configuration examples
- Duplicate information across different docs
- Over-detailed table comparisons for simple concepts

### Marketing Language

- Adjectives ("amazing", "powerful", "advanced", "modern", "beautiful", etc.)
- Excessive emoji usage for simple sections
- Promotional language about features
- Verbose explanations of obvious benefits

## What to Keep

### Critical Technical Information

- Unique architecture decisions (SSR optimizations, MathJax integration)
- Non-obvious configuration requirements
- Complex setup procedures that differ from standards
- Performance considerations and thresholds

### Essential API Information

- Environment variables with specific purposes
- Critical configuration options
- Non-standard build processes
- Integration-specific requirements

### Key Implementation Details

- Custom algorithms or business logic
- Third-party integration notes
- Performance monitoring thresholds
- Security considerations

### Troubleshooting (Selective)

- Common issues specific to this project
- Non-obvious error resolution
- Critical debugging information
- Project-specific gotchas

## Documentation Structure Guidelines

### README Files

- Lead with brief, factual description
- Focus on unique features, not standard tech stack benefits
- Include only essential setup commands
- Highlight critical configuration requirements
- End with minimal technical details

### Technical Documentation

- Start with overview of what makes this implementation unique
- Include only critical configuration options
- Focus on project-specific requirements
- Remove generic explanations of well-known tools

### API Documentation

- Include only non-standard usage patterns
- Document critical environment variables
- Explain complex integrations briefly
- Remove obvious parameter explanations

## Writing Style

### Be Concise

- Use direct, factual language
- Eliminate unnecessary words
- Combine related concepts
- Remove redundant explanations

### Focus on Value

- Each section should answer "Why is this different/important?"
- Remove content that doesn't help developers understand or implement
- Prioritize actionable information over descriptive content
- Include only critical examples

### Maintain Technical Accuracy

- Keep all technical details accurate
- Preserve critical code examples
- Maintain essential configuration information
- Don't remove important warnings or notes

## Example Transformations

### Before (Verbose)

```markdown
## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Full SSR support with static pre-rendering
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-rendered HTML for all routes
- **Interactive Components**: Educational components with modern UX
- **Beautiful Design**: Glassmorphism dark theme with gradient effects
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags, Open Graph, structured data, XML sitemap (717+ pages)
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices
```

### After (Concise)

```markdown
## 🚀 Features

- **Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS
- **SSR/SSG**: Pre-rendered HTML for optimal SEO and performance
- **MathJax Integration**: Advanced SSR-optimized mathematical expression rendering
```

### Before (Over-detailed)

`````markdown
### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hotmath

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### After (Essential)

````markdown
### Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hotmath
npm install
npm run dev  # → http://www.vt.local:3000
```
````
`````

## Implementation Notes

- Apply these rules consistently across all documentation
- Preserve unique technical details that differentiate this project
- Remove standard explanations of common tools and processes
- Focus on what makes this implementation special or different
- Keep code examples that show non-obvious usage patterns
- Maintain critical configuration and environment setup information

```
