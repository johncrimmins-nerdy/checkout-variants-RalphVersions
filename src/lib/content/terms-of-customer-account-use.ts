Because of this investment by Varsity, and also because of the nature of Varsity's purchase offerings, it is critical to Varsity's business to prohibit You from soliciting or contracting with a Professional outside the Platform when You were introduced to the Professional, directly or indirectly, through the Platform. This prohibition is irrespective of the purchase type You made. Moreover, Varsity, or its related and/or affiliated entities, has contracted with the Professionals and makes payments to them (so You have no reason to separately pay any Professional related to the services You receive hereunder). Accordingly, You agree not to solicit, attempt to solicit, or contract with Professionals on the Platform, directly or indirectly, for a period of two (2) years following the final Meeting or Session with any Professional obtained through the Platform (except through the Platform or with the express written consent of Varsity). You acknowledge that Varsity and/or its related and/or affiliated entities have a valid contract and/or business expectancy with the Professionals on Varsity's Platform who are subject to their own non-solicitation provision regarding customers obtained through the Platform. Violating the non-solicitation provision, or failing to notify Varsity in the event You have reason to believe a Professional is actually soliciting You or attempting to do so, also constitutes tortious interference with Varsity and/or its related and/or affiliated entities' contracts with the Professional for which You may be liable to Varsity for monetary damages and/or equitable relief, in addition to losing the benefits of other aspects of Your purchase. &nbsp;In the event of a violation, the Parties acknowledge that the actual costs and resulting damages (lost productivity, increased operating costs, lost advertising costs, lost customer acquisition costs, lost customer lifetime value, etc.) are difficult to ascertain, calculate, and foresee. You hereby agree that each violation of this provision shall result in a payment to Varsity in the amount of $5,000 as liquidated damages and You agree to pay all Varsity's costs and expenses incurred in enforcing these Terms, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><h5 class="c18 c37" id="h.6yppzdqhxzpb"><span class="c1">4.3 Professionals are Independent Contractors: </span></h5><p class="c18"><span class="c13">The Professionals on the Platform are independent contractors, not employees of Varsity or its related and/or affiliated entities, and Professionals have their own tutoring, instruction, and teaching styles and methods.

Arbitration provides for more limited discovery than in court, is subject to limited review by courts, and the result is confidential. &nbsp;Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing or through witnesses. An arbitrator generally can award the same damages and relief to You that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in these Terms.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c18"><span>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, You and Varsity agree that any legal or equitable claim, other than a claim under the </span><span class="c33"><a class="c2" href="#h.p3gm48n4gfve">Non-Solicitation</a></span><span>&nbsp;Section</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;relating to this Agreement, any addendum, the use of the platform, or the tutoring obtained from the platform (referred to as a "Claim"), will be resolved as follows: &nbsp;If a Claim cannot be resolved informally, any Claim asserted will be resolved only by binding arbitration. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator who is a member of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be held in St. Louis, Missouri or as mutually agreed between the parties and the arbitrator will apply Missouri substantive law, or federal law as applicable, in all respects. &nbsp;The arbitrator shall have all authority to determine the arbitrability of any claim and enter a final binding judgment at the conclusion of any proceedings. &nbsp;Any final judgment may be appealed only on the grounds of improper bias or improper conduct of the arbitrator. &nbsp;If You decide to initiate arbitration, You will have to submit a demand for arbitration with a filing fee to https://www.adr.org. &nbsp;Varsity agrees to reimburse You for the filing fee; however, all other fees related to the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, attorneys' fees, arbitration expenses, etc. shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA rules. You also agree that this arbitration agreement shall apply to any dispute with other parties arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, regardless of the date of accrual of such dispute. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c13">YOU AND VARSITY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THAT CLASS, MASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE NOT PERMITTED. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c13">These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c13">This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of these Terms. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate shall still be considered valid and enforceable. &nbsp;If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, You and Varsity waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any claims to recover punitive or exemplary damages and any right to pursue any claims on a class, mass, consolidated, or combined basis.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c13">The arbitrator shall not award relief in excess of what is allowed by applicable law and the Agreement. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the Parties agree that any declaratory or injunctive award may be vacated or corrected on appeal by either party to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Each party will bear its own costs and fees on any such appeal.
